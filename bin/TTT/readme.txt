TicTacToe usage:

to run the program, type either

java TicTacToe

or

java TicTacToe <hostname>

if no hostname is given, the program will wait for a connection from another machine.

If a hostname or IP address is given, it will try to connect to the TicTacToe program running there.

You could always practice by trying

java TicTacToe

then

java TicTacToe 127.0.0.1
or
java TicTacToe localhost

Then you would be playing against yourself on the one machine.

Enjoy!
